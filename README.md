<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a 21 year old male that lives in a small town named Roxby Downs.
I've lived here for most of my life, originally from Broken Hill, New South Wales. I spend most of my time at home on my computer, gaming, browsing social media, watching shows, movies and videos on YouTube. When i'm not doing that i'm either doing shut down work on the mine site for BHP trying to earn some money whilst I do my university studies through RMIT online or i'm around my girlfriend for the rest of my time during the day.

<h3>Interest In Information Technology</h3>

My interest in IT began about 4 years ago when i got my first desktop computer and was still in school. At the time I had no idea what i wanted to do with my life after i finished, its something i always pondered on because i couldn't understand how people already knew what they wanted to be when they finished school. I tried TAFE in year 11 and 12 doing a cert 2 and 3 in metal and fabrication but in the end I didn't finish it not being that interested in the subject. The town I come from is big for mining, this always made me assume that I was going to end up in that line of work because all my family that lived in the town were working at the mine or have worked there in the past. I didn't want to end up as a sheep that followed my family into that field, so as i obtained my first desktop PC my interest in IT grew larger, seeing new technology advance every day amazed me weather it was new computer hardware or software, a new drone, robot etc... anything in tech was interesting to me. I was fascinated in learning about the components of computers and how to replace certain parts or fix it the right way I would try to teach myself as much as I could. This year i decided to enroll into university to study Information technology to not only learn but challenge myself with knowledge and maybe give a different meaning to my life in the future.
